          <h2 class="dreamer">Professional Dreamer</h2>
          <p> A long time ago, I developed an understanding of language and the power of words.  I fell in love with books about other worlds, and in my dreams have created worlds of my own.  I am a writer, an author, a professional designer of universes. </p>
          <p> A long time ago, I developed a love of coding.  I enjoy the complexity. It is another form of expression, a different way to describe a thing. In code, in p's and ems, and percentages. HTML, Java, C++, .net are my ambitions.  </p>
          <p> A long time ago, I developed a love of learning.  I am a student. I have been for as long as I can remember, and I hope to never stop. </p>
